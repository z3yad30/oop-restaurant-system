# oop-restaurant-system
My first OOP project in C++ — built a restaurant system
# OOP Restaurant System

This was my **first Object-Oriented Programming project** in C++, built around 2 years ago during university.  
It’s a console-based restaurant ordering system with:

## 📦 Features
- Menu creation and editing (name, category, price, stock)
- Order processing (adding dishes, quantities, calculating total)
- Discount system with predefined codes
- Payment system (cash or credit)
- Basic navigation through menu options

## 👥 Teamwork
This was a team project, and I had the opportunity to **lead the team** — managing the structure, logic, and most of the implementation.

## 🛠 Tech Used
- Language: C++
- Concepts: OOP (Classes, Structs, Static Members, Friend Classes)
- Input/output handling via console

## ⚠️ Notes
> This was a beginner-level project, and the code reflects that. It's not optimized or scalable — but it helped me understand how to apply OOP concepts in a real way.  
> The project is **not meant for production**, just as a milestone of my learning journey.

## 🔄 Future Improvements
- Refactor to use STL containers like `vector` instead of arrays
- Break repeated logic into reusable functions
- Improve validation and modularity
- Possibly upgrade to GUI or web-based version

Thanks for checking it out! If you're just starting out too: keep building, even if it’s messy 💻🔥
